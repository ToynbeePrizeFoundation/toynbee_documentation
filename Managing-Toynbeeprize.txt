Managing Site
=============

.. _adding-users:
Adding Users
------------------
Create user accounts for new Forum Contributors and new Editors at Large. For Blog authors, use the "Guest Author" function.

Forum Contributors and Interviewees
^^^^
To date, the contributors have not edited their material within WordPress, so it is possible to create a pseudo account for them. Use the user information in BaseCamp. Forum Contributors should be added as "Authors" and should be given institutional information in the "Bio" area.

Editors at Large
^^^^
Editors at Large log into the Wordpress system in order to nominate content. These users require working accounts with their given email address and a default login. They should be added as "Contributors." Their institutional affiliation should be added to the "Bio" area and the "Editors at Large" Members list should be checked.

Authors of Syndicated content
^^^^^
Syndicated authors can be added as Guest Authors using "Users -> Guest Authors". This allows for a duplication of the author functionality without requiring the email address information (this can be added but is not required).


Adding Recent Publications
------------------
The bibliography is pulled from the "Current Publications" library within the Global History Group using ScholarPress Researcher. Add new citations to this Zotero Library for them to appear on the site.


Adding Resources
-------------------
This section is currently in draft until we have gathered a critical mass of Resources to highlight. 

Creating Resources
^^^
- Resources are added as Posts, with category "Resources." They will not appear in the feeds or on the home page. 

- Add tags to designate type of resource.

- Use the "Featured Image" to display a screen shot of the resource or program page.

Displaying Resources
^^^
Once live, use "Widgets on Pages" and "Recent Posts Extended" to display the resources posts.


Publishing Forum Content
======================
Assign Category and Tags
--------------
- For Forum content, use the "Forum" Category. 
- The tags should be descriptive and should adhere to a standard vocabulary to help people browse by topic areas across forum posts, resources, and blog posts.

Set Authors
----------------
For submitted pieces, add the author (who has already been created as a user - see :ref:`adding-users`). For interviews, add both the interviewer and the subject (both will display). If the post creator is different than the author, remove the post creator.

Commenting
-------------
For Forum pieces, enable commenting. 

Set Featured Image
------------------------
The current default featured image is the tan map. To set a featured imaged for individual posts, use the "Set Featured Image" box in the lower right corner of the add posts page. The size of the featured image is restricted to thumbnail size. This is controlled in the stylesheet.

And publish.

Publishing Blog Content
==========
Reviewing and Selecting Content via PressForward Plugin
------------------------
Reviewing Content
^^^^
All content coming in through the feeds is viewable in "All Content." Use the right facing arrow to send items to "Under Review". Editors at Large see the "All Content" page.

Selecting Content
^^^^
From "Under Review", the editor can see the number of nominations and the comments on any particular piece. Use the double right facing arrows to create a draft of those pieces to be published on the blog.

Title
---------
Add Tag name to the beginning of the title to aid link recognition (Editors' Choice for thought pieces; News area for news pieces)

Linking Out
---------------
- Add link at bottom of post directing the reader back to the original content. 
- For thought pieces, only include a short "snippet" of the content in order to respect copyright. Link out to the original post for the whole piece.

Assign Category and Tags
--------------
- For Blog content, use the "Global History Blog" category. 
- For new items, assign "Announcements", "Conferences and CFPs", "Jobs", or "Funding and Opportunities".
- For thought pieces, assign "Editors Choice" tag and added descriptive tags according to the Forum fixed vocabulary.

Set Authors
----------------
- For news items, set the Author to "Toynbee Editors" and remove the post creator.
- For thought pieces, use Guest User to create a display name that links to content. Set the Author to the corresponding Guest Author. (see :ref:`adding-users`)

Commenting
-------------
Turn off commenting for syndicated content.

Set Featured Image
------------------------
Set unique featured image if desired.

And Publish.
