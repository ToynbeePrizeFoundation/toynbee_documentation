Adding Users
------------------



Publishing Content on Toynbeeprize.org
================================

Generally, new content to the site should be added as "posts." Distinctions between content for the Forum, the Blog, and the Resources is managed by the Categories, while tagging is used to designate both type of content and topics.

Authors 
-----------
Forum Posts:
^^^^^^^^^^^
Author information is linked in this theme, so it is necessary to create user accounts for new contributors to the blog and for those interviewed for the Forum. See :ref:`adding-users`.  

Using the 

Blog Posts:
^^^^^^^^^
For the blog, by contrast, we can use the guest author function to display the name of the author without creating the user account of the site, particularly as we are not using the author functionality for these pieces.



Categories
--------------
Forum:
^^^^^^^^^
	- Use the "Forum" category to designate pieces that are part of the Global History Forum. These are pieces generated by or submitted to Toynbee and are "sanctioned" by the foundation.
	- While Timothy is largely in charge of generating content, as GRA, we help solicit new content for the forum.

Global History Blog
^^^^^^^^^
	- Use the "Global History Blog" category to designate pieces that are curated from web. Run similarly to DigitalHumanitiesNow, the Blog is one of the primary responsibilities of the GRA.
	- Use tags to designate the type of content.

Resources
^^^^^^^^^
	- Use the "Resources" category to designate posts for the growing list of programs, centers, and fellowships related to Global History.
	- This category is excluded from the home page and from the feeds.


Tags
-----------------
Tagging has three functions: 
1. First, to designate types of content on the blog.

Announcements
^^^^^^^^^
	- Various announcements of interest to the community, including publication of books, movement of faculty, issuing of awards, etc.

Conferences and CFPs
^^^^^^^^^
	- Also includes workshops and lectures

Editors' Choice
^^^^^^^^^
	- Thought and opinion pieces published on the web.

Jobs
^^^^^^^^^
	- Jobs that focus on Global History

Funding and Opportunities
^^^^^^^^^
	- Opportunities and funding beyond job postings that support work in global history.


2. Second, to link Forum posts and References to one another by reference to content areas.

Centers and Institutes
^^^^^^^^^
	- Listing of centers at various institutions that support the study of Global History.

Programs of Study
^^^^^^^^^
	- Listing of degree granting programs in global history. Possibly to be merged with centers and institutes.


3. Third, there a number of tags that need to be generated in order to relate programs, topics, interviews, and authors to one another. These categories are not yet determined.


Featured Images
------------------------
The current default featured image is the tan map. To set a featured imaged for individual posts, use the "Set Featured Image" box in the lower right corner of the add posts page. The size of the featured image is restricted to thumbnail size. This is controlled in the stylesheet.
