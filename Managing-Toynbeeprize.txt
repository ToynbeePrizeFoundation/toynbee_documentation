.. _adding-users:
Adding Users
------------------
Create user accounts for new Forum Contributors and new Editors at Large. For Blog authors, use the "Guest Author" function.

Forum Contributors and Interviewees
^^^^
To date, the contributors have not edited their material within WordPress, so it is possible to create a pseudo account for them. Use the user information in BaseCamp. Forum Contributors should be added as "Authors" and should be given institutional information in the "Bio" area.

Editors at Large
^^^^
Editors at Large log into the Wordpress system in order to nominate content. These users require working accounts with their given email address and a default login. They should be added as "Contributors." Their institutional affiliation should be added to the "Bio" area and the "Editors at Large" Members list should be checked.


Adding Recent Publications
------------------
The bibliography is pulled from the "Current Publications" library within the Global History Group using ScholarPress Researcher. Add new citations to this Zotero Library for them to appear on the site.


Adding Resources
-------------------
This section is currently in draft until we have gathered a critical mass of Resources to highlight. 

Creating Resources
^^^
- Resources are added as Posts, with category "Resources." They will not appear in the feeds or on the home page. 

- Add tags to designate type of resource.

- Use the "Featured Image" to display a screen shot of the resource or program page.

Displaying Resources
^^^
Once live, use "Widgets on Pages" and "Recent Posts Extended" to display the resources posts.


Publishing Forum Content
======================
Determine Excerpt for Home Page
----------------------
To keep things readable on the home page, use the "Read More tag" to designate how much content will appear on Search, Archive, and Home pages.

Assign Category and Tags
--------------
- For Forum content, use the "Forum" Category. 
- The tags should be descriptive and should adhere to a standard vocabulary to help people browse by topic areas across forum posts, resources, and blog posts.

Set Authors
----------------
For submitted pieces, add the author (who has already been created as a user - see :ref:`adding-users`). For interviews, add both the interviewer and the subject (both will display). If the post creator is different than the author, remove the post creator.

Commenting
-------------
For Forum pieces, enable commenting. 

Set Featured Image
------------------------
The current default featured image is the tan map. To set a featured imaged for individual posts, use the "Set Featured Image" box in the lower right corner of the add posts page. The size of the featured image is restricted to thumbnail size. This is controlled in the stylesheet.

And publish.
