Introduction to Managing toynbeeprize.org
***********************

Project Vision and Goal
====================
The current goal of the Toynbee website is to promote the publication of scholarship in Global History and to become a central and respected source for current and developing scholarship in the field. This is being pursued in a couple of different ways. 

First is the Global History Forum, which solicits thought pieces on Global History as well as interviews of scholars in the field. The interviews are being conducted and edited by Timothy Nunan. 

Second is the Global History Blog, which curates web content related to Global History. The GRA and the Editors at Large are responsible for nominating and publishing this content. Ideally, the Blog can uncover growing conversations in the field that can, in turn, generate more structured Forum contributions.

Third, the Forum serves to highlight the recipient of the Toynbee Prize and the conference panel on Global History at the AHA. This involves posting information about the current recipient and their talk, if available. In years of the panel, one idea is to post about the panel topic early and invite conversation.

In addition to Timothy's interviews and solicitations of material, possible sources include asking authors in the New Global History Journal to either expand or write about new ideas inspired in the process of writing their published piece.
